# homework-1-horiseon.github.io

## Introduction & [link to my page!](https://coryfay.github.io/CoryFayHomework-1-Horiseon.github.io/)
  This is my first working Github Repo.
  
  I was assigned the task of refactoring an existing .html and .css to adhere to accessibility standards. By implementing semantic .html the new site is optimized for search engines. 

## Troubles I faced
 * The greatest issue i faced was that i was not able to publish [my original Repo.](https://github.com/CoryFay/Homework-1#homework-1githubio) Please reference this page in order to see the commits i pushed forward while editing the original index.html and style.css files. 
    * For some reason, while trying to publish the original repo, I ran into an issue with the webpage popping up as a 404 error. I believe this issue was due to my index.html page being inside of a folder in the repo and it wasn't able to access it. I messed around with this for some time, my commits will show this, until i decided to setup a new repo with my edited .html file outside of its main folder. This seemed to solve the problem for now, and going forward i will be sure to add an index.html file prior to any coding. 
 
 * The second big issue i faced was dealing with the 'aside' section of my webpage. I was having trouble getting it to float to the right and spent alot of time looking over both the .html and .css file. The problem ended up being that i had added an unnecessary 'element' that was containing both of the 'elements' i was trying to float. This restricted me from being able to float them properly. 
  
 * The last issue i faced was figuring out why one of the links in the page was not functioning properly. This was the easiest fix for me, as i discovered rather quickly that the link was missing an #id that would allow it to navigate properly. 
 
## Reflection
  Looking back on this project i feel a great sense of accomplishment. While i don't consider this to be an outstanding feat, i am proud of the determination i had in sticking this out. I ran into several problems that held me up for hours at a time, but ultimately i stuck it out and continued pursuing solutions. I know that when my next challenges arise I will be able to conquer them as well.
